## Five Planes of UX

### Strategy

- **What value does the project provide?** This project provides a website for an online community of parents and carers to share honest reviews and experiences with children's toys as a way to inform other parents and carers before they buy the toys. On top of that, it also provides context for the review in the form of sharing what other toys the child likes. For example a child that likes toy cars and trucks may rate a doll low, or a child that likes footballs and frisbees may rate a trampoline highly.
- **What are the business needs?** The business needs are to provide an intuitive, pleasant looking, and accessible website to entice more users to join and add their own data to the database. In future, affiliate links may be used to link users to buying products, which will provide income to the business.
- **Who is the target audience?** There are two target audiences for this web application. Firstly, anyone who is looking to buy a child a toy, be it parents, relatives, guardians etc who would like clear honest feedback on which toy would be suitable. Secondly, those with children who can lend their expertise and experience in their reviews and recommendations on toys.
- **What are the user requirements and expectations?** The users can make their own profile in order to read and submit reviews of their own. They also expect to be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete their own profile, toy data, and reviews whenever they want. It is expected that they can search toys to read reviews and also see other user's profiles.
