# Toy Tribe

*An online community for rating, reviewing, and recommending children's toys. Insightful feedback from parents and guardians*

This full stack review website for children's toys was born from my wife and I's experience with finding the right toys for our child when he was young, resulting in toys that were rarely touched if ever, and not enough of the toys that were stimulating and engaging. Every child is different and we attempt to overcome that difficulty when recommending toys by providing recommendations based on what your child already enjoys. The target audience are parents, carers, primary school teachers, and others with first-hand experience of how children have responded to their toys.

## Five Planes of UX

### Strategy

- **What value does the project provide?** This project provides a website for an online community of parents and carers to share honest reviews and experiences with children's toys as a way to inform other parents and carers before they buy the toys. On top of that, it also provides context for the review in the form of sharing what other toys the child likes. For example a child that likes toy cars and trucks may rate a doll low, or a child that likes footballs and frisbees may rate a trampoline highly.
- **What are the business needs?** The business needs are to provide an intuitive, pleasant looking, and accessible website to entice more users to join and add their own data to the database. In future, affiliate links may be used to link users to buying products, which will provide income to the business.
- **Who is the target audience?** There are two target audiences for this web application. Firstly, anyone who is looking to buy a child a toy, be it parents, relatives, guardians etc who would like clear honest feedback on which toy would be suitable. Secondly, those with children who can lend their expertise and experience in their reviews and recommendations on toys.
- **What are the user requirements and expectations?** The users can make their own profile in order to read and submit reviews of their own. They also expect to be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete their own profile, toy data, and reviews whenever they want. It is expected that they can search toys to read reviews and also see other user's profiles.

#### Viability and Feasibility
Followed is an analysis of the above user and business needs ranked from 1 (least important/viable) to 5 (most important/viable):
|   Task |   Importance | Viability/Feasibility |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Easy to navigate | 5 | 5 |
| Responsive | 5 | 5 |
| Immediate feedback to the user | 5 | 5 |
| Accessible | 5 | 5 |
| Store information securely | 5 | 3 |
| Informative and welcoming home screen | 5 | 5 |
| 404 page with link to homepage | 5 | 5 |
| Contact details for the developer | 3 | 5 |

Overall, the above listed features to include in the site are all important and viable. Viability is ranked lower for those that I do not know how to implement yet but every effort will be made to get these into the finished product.

### Scope

#### Back-end
Multiple tables within a database are required for this project. These models are:
- **User** table that keeps track of the user's name, email, and password for created users.
- **Toy** table that keeps track of the toy name, company, type, and image url for created toys.
- **Review** table that keeps track of the review, rating, the user that left the review, the toy being reviewed, and similar toys children liked for created reviews.
- **Profile** table that keeps track the about me section, country, whether they are a parent, created toys, and created reviews for the user.

### Front-end
The website will utilise template inheritance that allows for less code to be written and quicker load times for a better user experience.
**Templates**
- base.html: This will be the base template that the others call from to ensure a cohesive structure across the website. Present here will be:
    - The header with the brand logo and title and the navigation links. Whilst logged out the navigation links will be replaced with buttons for login / sign up. When logged in the navigation bar will offer links to the user's own profile, and to view toys.
    - The footer with site name, logo, and contact information.
- toys.html: This will act as the website homepage. If the user is not logged in it will display a welcome message to the website and some text and a link for the user to either login or sign up. When logged in it will display all the toys currently reviewed on the website. Clicking on a toy will take the user to the individual toy page.
- add_toy.html: This will open a form in which the user can fill out details of a toy and submit it to be shown in the toys.html page.
- toy.html: The page for an individual toy showing information on the toy and allowing users to upload, edit, or delete their own reviews.
- edit_toy.html: This will open a form in which the user that created a toy can edit the details.
- add_review.html: This will open a form in which the user can enter and submit a review for the toy.
- edit_review.html: This will open a form in which the user can ammend their own review.
- user_profile.html: This page will show the public information of the user.
- edit_user.html: This will open a form to allow the user to edit their own user profile.
