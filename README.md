# Toy Tribe

*An online community for rating, reviewing, and recommending children's toys. Insightful feedback from parents and guardians*

This full stack review website for children's toys was born from my wife and I's experience with finding the right toys for our child when he was young, resulting in toys that were rarely touched if ever, and not enough of the toys that were stimulating and engaging. Every child is different and we attempt to overcome that difficulty when recommending toys by providing recommendations based on what your child already enjoys. The target audience are parents, carers, primary school teachers, and others with first-hand experience of how children have responded to their toys.
